Youtube video Summarizer using AI models
This project provides summarized information from YouTube videos by automating the process of downloading, extracting audio, transcribing with an AI model, and summarizing with Hugging Face's transformers library. By providing a YouTube link, you can access summarized information, making it beneficial users, researchers, and individuals who require a streamlined way to digest video content.
